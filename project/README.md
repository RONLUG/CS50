## Tools used in this project
- Figma and Miro for designing the website.
- Docker for using cs50 codespace.
- Git and Github for saving backups.
- VScode for code editing.

## Challenges
Initially this project was not intended to use cs50 library, mainly because I want to know what are things that being used in real industry, but due to time constrain and my lack of experience in OOP made me redo this project with cs50 library that I'm more comfortable with.
